# ArithmeticOperations Contract

## Overview

The `ArithmeticOperations` contract is a simple Solidity contract that performs basic arithmetic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. It is designed to be deployed on the Ethereum blockchain, providing functionality to perform these operations with unsigned integers.

The contract includes error handling to:
- Prevent negative values in the subtraction operation.
- Prevent division by zero in the division operation.

## Contract Functions

### 1. **add(uint a, uint b)**
- **Description**: Adds two unsigned integers `a` and `b`.
- **Returns**: The sum of `a` and `b` (i.e., `a + b`).

### 2. **subtract(uint a, uint b)**
- **Description**: Subtracts unsigned integer `b` from unsigned integer `a`.
- **Returns**: The difference of `a - b`.
- **Error Handling**: The function includes a `require` statement to ensure that `a` is greater than or equal to `b`. If `b` is greater than `a`, it will revert with the message `"Subtraction results in a negative value"`.

### 3. **multiply(uint a, uint b)**
- **Description**: Multiplies two unsigned integers `a` and `b`.
- **Returns**: The product of `a` and `b` (i.e., `a * b`).

### 4. **divide(uint a, uint b)**
- **Description**: Divides unsigned integer `a` by unsigned integer `b`.
- **Returns**: The quotient of `a / b`.
- **Error Handling**: The function includes a `require` statement to prevent division by zero. If `b` is zero, the transaction will revert with the message `"Division by zero is not allowed"`.

## Sample Inputs and Outputs

### 1. **Addition:**
- **Function Call**: `add(10, 5)`
- **Input**: `a = 10`, `b = 5`
- **Output**: `15`

### 2. **Subtraction:**
- **Function Call**: `subtract(10, 5)`
- **Input**: `a = 10`, `b = 5`
- **Output**: `5`
- **Edge Case**: `subtract(5, 10)` will revert with the message `"Subtraction results in a negative value"`.

### 3. **Multiplication:**
- **Function Call**: `multiply(10, 5)`
- **Input**: `a = 10`, `b = 5`
- **Output**: `50`

### 4. **Division:**
- **Function Call**: `divide(10, 5)`
- **Input**: `a = 10`, `b = 5`
- **Output**: `2`
- **Edge Case**: `divide(10, 0)` will revert with the message `"Division by zero is not allowed"`.

## Contract Deployment

To deploy this contract, follow these steps:
1. Use an Ethereum development environment such as **Remix** or **Truffle**.
2. Compile the contract and deploy it on a testnet or the Ethereum mainnet.

### Example Deployment:
1. Open **Remix** and paste the contract code.
2. Compile the contract using the Remix Solidity compiler.
3. Deploy the contract to the selected Ethereum network.

## Security Considerations

1. **Subtraction Check**: The `subtract` function ensures that `a` is always greater than or equal to `b` by using the `require` statement. This prevents potential errors in contracts that could arise from negative values in unsigned integers.
   
2. **Division by Zero**: The `divide` function ensures that division by zero is avoided by checking that the divisor (`b`) is not zero before performing the division. This prevents runtime errors and ensures the contract behaves safely.
